Description= openCEM base case simulates AEMO ISP Rapid cost assumptions
  for electricity demand, technology and fuel costs.
  Includes Effective LRET, VRET and QRET as well as a 28%% reduction of emissions by 2030.
  All targets are assumed to remain constant beyond the last year they are specified in available sources.
  Includes CST 3h and CST 12h as build options and uses a collector-only trace for CSP so dispatch of storage is managed
  by the openCEM engine.
