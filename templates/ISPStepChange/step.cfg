Description= openCEM ISP Step change scenario configuration. Template retrieves AEMO ISP Step change assumptions
  regarding demand profile and  technology and fuel cost forecasts.
  Exogenous transmission includes ISP Step change DP4 Augmentations
  Includes Effective LRET, VRET and QRET and an accelerated emissions reduction pathway.
  All targets are assumed to remain constant beyond the last year they are specified in available sources.
  Includes CST 12h as build options and uses a collector-only trace for CSP so dispatch of storage is managed
  by the openCEM engine.
