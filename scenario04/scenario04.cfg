Description= openCEM simulating a modification to the base case where
  a Emissions reduction trajectory of 52%% by 2030 and 90%% by 2050 from 2005 levels
  RET is imposed. Emission limits correspond only to the NEM share of emission reductions across all sectors.
  Trajectory obtained from AEMO ISP 2018 (fast change scenario).
  Includes Effective LRET, VRET and QRET.
  All targets are assumed to remain constant beyond the last year they are specified in available sources.
  Includes CST 3h and CST 12h as build options and uses a collector-only trace for CSP so dispatch of storage is managed
  by the openCEM engine.
