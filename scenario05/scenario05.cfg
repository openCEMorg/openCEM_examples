Description= openCEM simulating a modification to the base case with a carbon price pathway.
  The pathway corresponds to the median price of all scenarios in the IPCC SR1.5 database that achieve
  below 1.5degC of peak warming within the 21st century. Carbon prices adjusted from 2010 USD to 2017 AUD.
