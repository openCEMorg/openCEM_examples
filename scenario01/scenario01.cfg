Description= openCEM base case simulates AEMO ISP Neutral assumptions
  regarding demand and cost forecasts.
  Includes Effective LRET, VRET and QRET as well as a 28%% reduction of emissions by 2030.
  All targets are assumed to remain constant beyond the last year they are specified in available sources.
